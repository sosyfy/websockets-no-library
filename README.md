# WebSockets Implementation

A WebSockets implementation without using any libraries, built with Node.js.

## Summary

This WebSockets implementation is a basic example of how to use WebSockets in Node.js without using any libraries. It demonstrates the use of the built-in `http` and `net` modules to create a WebSockets server and handle client connections. The server can handle multiple clients and broadcast messages to all connected clients.

## Features

- A basic WebSockets server built with Node.js using the built-in `http` and `net` modules
- Broadcast messages to all connected client
- No external libraries are used

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sosyfy/websockets-no-library.git`
2. Start the server: `node server.js`
3. Connect to the server using a WebSockets client, such as the browser's developer console
4. Send and receive messages between the server and clients

## Note

This is a basic implementation and may not include all the features or security considerations of a production-ready WebSockets server. It is intended for educational and demonstration purposes only.
